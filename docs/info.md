## How it works

Takes two single bits as input and outputs three signals to indicate if the first bit is less than, equal to, or greater than the second bit

## How to test

Apply all four possible input combinations ((A,B) are (0,0); (0,1); (1,0); (1,1)) and verify that the three outputs ((A>B), (A<B), (A=B)) match the expected outputs

## External hardware

3 LEDs
